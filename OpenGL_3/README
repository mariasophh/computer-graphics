# COMMON ANIMATION
The results can be found under /Screenshots.

We have defined a new struct, namely sceneObject that stores all the necessary information of an object. Thus, we avoid code duplication as all the provided functions support multiple scene objects. 

In the scene we have two different meshes: cat and sphere, with two instances of each. Every object has a different texture. We have borrowed textures that were given in the last RayTracer assignment (i.e. earth texture, basketball texture).

All four instances are animated in a different way:
1. CAT DIFF: translated with its defined speed along the y-axis (changes direction when it exceeds the set boundaries) and it does a full rotation in 1 second along the y-axis
2. CAT NORM: translated with its defined speed along the y-axis (changes direction when it exceeds the set boundaries) and it does a faster rotation along the x-axis

The cats always move in opposite directions.

3. PLANET (EARTH): it rotates along all the axis and its size increases until it reaches a scale of 1.5; this object is never translated
4. (BASKET) BALL: this object is translated with its defined speed along the x-axis (changes direction when it exceeds the set boundaries). When the PLANET stops increasing, BALL starts increasing until it reaches a scale of 1.5; this object is never rotated

Unfortunately, we had difficulties with implementing the camera movements.
